# Catatool: A Custom-Built Server Cataloguing Tool

A server cataloguing tool I built for the EHPC server at the EHEP Lab at IISER Mohali. It is not a full-fledged tool and does not do end-to-end automation.

Cataloguing event generation, simulation runs and data in a lab server is very important and must be done regularly. Hence it is wise to invest in writing code snippets which can automate a part of this process.

Acknowledgement: I thank [Sourav Suresh](https://github.com/sourav-suresh) for motivating me to make this tool.
